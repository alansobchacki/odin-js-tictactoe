Project: Tic-Tac-Toe
=============

A basic app that allows users to play a 'hotseat' game of tic-tac-toe against another player.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-js-tictactoe/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the second project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [2/12].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Have as little global code as possible. Try tucking as much as you can inside factory functions.
- [x] Write a function to check for all winning 3-in-a-rows and ties. 
- [x] Write a function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage.
- [x] Write the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board by interacting with the appropriate DOM elements (e.g. letting players click on a board square to place their marker). Also, don't forget to include the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken.
- [x] Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names.
- [x] Include a button to start/restart the game.
- [x] Add a display element that shows the results upon game end. 

What I Learned
-----

Writing all the scripting logic inside a single factory function was fun. Reminded me of how I used to write Ruby code. I also learned how to use the '.every()' method.

Notes
-----

Currently, you can only play against another human player (or against yourself). 

Playing against the computer was NOT a project requirement, but does sound fun to implement. I'll be sure to revisit this repository later on.
